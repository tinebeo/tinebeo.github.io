        <p>Lima is the city and capital of Peru. Lima is considered as Peru's commercial and industrial centre. Lima's nickname is El Pulpo (“The Octopus”). Lima is the a fourth of the total population of Peru. This is a result of concentration of people, capital, political influence, and social innovations. For a long time, Lima was the only point of contact between the country and other countries.</p>

            
        <p>Lima's city layout is strongly influenced by its long history. The checked street layout comes from Spanish colonists during the 16th century. Lima also has many colonial buildings. For example, The Presidential Palacen and many more reflect the past popularity of the French Empire style.
        </p>

        <p>Lima's population has transformed since the 1930s. It is now hard to find a true Limeño. Everywhere, one can hear different tones, accents, which reflects different origins who have come to this city. Before arrival of migrants, it was easy to tell between European and other ethnic mixtures. Modern-day Lima, however, classification is no longer easy. Currently, the only classification that persists is rich and influencial versus poor and powerless.</p>
            
        <p>In spite problems that face Lima and those those who reside in the city, it is still the dominant and most vibrant cultural centre of Peru.</p>
