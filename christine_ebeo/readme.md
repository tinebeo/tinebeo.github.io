## Tasks
- [x] Push the project HTML, CSS, and JS code to GitHub

## Learning Curve and challengers
- index.html, had trouble implementing the preloader using plain JS. Had to use jQuery. Solution looks shorter too.
- about.html, had trouble with the video gallery because it was not switching images initially. I was able to do so by using setInterval. Had trouble with form, keeps refreshing when I hit submit. 
- city.html, I used getElementsByClassName and wanted to append content, but it wasn't working. Turns out I had to grab the first index to do what I wanted.

## Resources
- Phase 1 and 2
- Google, StackOverflow, various JS articles
