            <h2>About Us</h2>
            
            <p>
                Hello and welcome, Amigo! We are a group of four who loves to travel and we want to share our awesome ideas with you! From simply browsing our pages to even using us as your travel guide, let us be here for you! We have various pages you can visit and here is a quick run through on each of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                You do not know anything about where you are going? You want to learn its history? In our <span class="tab">city</span> tab, we provide you with a short history of various cities from different parts of the world. Learning about a country enables you to become an informed traveller. It increases general awareness and allows people to become more open-minded. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You want to visit top locations for a country? In our <span class="tab">hotspots</span> tab, we provide you with places that will certainly be worth the visit. Get your most comfy shoes on, camera ready, and be ready for a lot of walking sight-seeing. You might get lost, but that's part of the adventure!
            </p>
            <p>
                You are hungry, thirsty? In our <span class="tab">food and drinks</span> tab, we provide you with amazing places to dine. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, or looking for a place to just drink the night away? We got you, but proceed with caution! May cause hangover, so enjoy responsibly!
            </p>
            <p>
                Not sure how to go around the city? Everything is too far by foot? In our <span class="tab">transportation</span> tab, we provide you with details on how to navigate through cities. From buses, to trains, to taxis, and so much more.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a long day of adventures, you are tired and not sure where to sleep? In our <span class="tab">accomodation</span> tab, we provide you with places to stay. Of course, you will need to recharge after all the travelling you will be doing.
            </p>

                You are in the shop 'til you drop mood? In our <span class="tab">shopping</span> tab, we provide you with top destinations for shopping. You might even find the perfect souvenir here!

            <p>
                You are curious about the city's geographical area and how much more you can travel? In our <span class="tab">map</span> tab, we provide you with a geological view of a city. I mean you can use maps, but you are here anyway, let us help you with that!
            </p>
            <p>
