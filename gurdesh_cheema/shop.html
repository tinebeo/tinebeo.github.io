                            half) and Shibuya Station.</p>

                        <p> Shibuya was historically the site of a castle in which the Shibuya family resided from the
                            11th century through the Edo period. Following the opening of the Yamanote Line in 1885,
                            Shibuya began to emerge as a railway terminal for southwestern Tokyo and eventually as a
                            major commercial and entertainment center.</p>

                        <p>The name "Shibuya" is also used to refer to the shopping district which surrounds Shibuya
                            Station. This area is known as one of the fashion centers of Japan, particularly for young
                            people, and as a major nightlife area</p>

                        <p>Singapore’s Chinatown Street Market is one of the city’s most popular spots to visit. The
                            shops and stalls in this bustling downtown area cover whole streets, including Pagoda
                            Street, Trengganu Street, Sago Lane, Smith Street, and Temple Street. </p>

                        <p>The sights and sounds of the street market are exactly what visitors expect of Chinatown,
                            with hundreds of stalls selling everything from clothing to homeware, technology to
                            handicrafts. </p>

                        <P>The market is mostly open during the day from around 10am, but it's most picturesque at dusk,
                            with the lights shining brightly and the sound of hawkers tempting you to check out their
                            wares. Just strolling the evening streets is a wonderful experience. The colonial
                            architecture, coupled with the hanging red lanterns, is an unmistakable snapshot of
                            Singaporean culture.</P>

                        <p>Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with several chains having their

                            area and main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis, Oxford Street has suffered from
                            traffic congestion, pedestrian congestion, a poor safety record and pollution. Various

                        <p>There's more to Rio de Janeiro than its beaches, and the artistic heart of the city can be
                            found up in the jungle-clad hills of Santa Teresa. Here, pastel-colored colonial mansions
                            have been converted into lively bars, friendly guest houses, artists' studios, vintage
                            stores and some of the best restaurants in Rio. The lofty location makes for some terrific
                            views over the city. Start your visit to Santa Teresa at Largo do Guimaraes, the busy square
                            at the start of the city, and follow the steep cobbled streets to discover vintage clothes
                            stores, bustling drinking dens and some of the friendliest locals in the city.</p>
